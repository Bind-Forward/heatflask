## AssemblyScript code for WASM
The `.ts` files in this folder are [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) code that will be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly) `.wasm` files.

The WebAssembly exports are exported from [`wasm.ts`](wasm.ts) and are accessed from [`myWasm.ts`](../js/DotLayer/myWasm.ts).
