# Heatflask frontend 
This is the client-side code for [Heatflask](https://www.heatflask.com), which will run in the end-user's browser.  It is written in plain "vanilla" JavaScript (ES6+).  We assume the user is running a modern, up-to-date browser like Firefox or Chrome.  We will not make any effort to support IE or any browser versioned over a couple of years old. 

## Contributing
If you want to try your hand at Heatflask development, fork this repo and clone it to your machine.  These instuctions assume you are using Linux.  I have not tried development on another OS. New to Linux? I recommend [Pop_OS!](https://system76.com/pop). The backend currently runs on Python 3.8. You will need installed on your machine:
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (Node Package Manager)

Specifications for frontend development are given in [`package.json`](/frontend/package.json), which is used by `npm` to create the environment.

Navigate to this ([`/frontend`](/frontend)) directory in a terminal and run
```
npm install
```

This will create a directory called `node_modules` and install all of the frontend dependencies into that directory.  `node_modules` is set to be ignored by git (see [.gitignore](/.gitignore)) so those files won't be part of a commit.

For development, run `npm run watch` in the `/frontend` directory.  This will call the [Parcel](https://www.parceljs.com) bundler to build all the frontend modules and put the distrubution code into a few `.js` bundles (one for each HTML file) in a new directory called `/frontend/dist`, which is also ignored by Git.

`npm run watch` starts a daemon process that rebuilds the dependency bundles every time a file in [`/frontend/src`](/frontend/src) changes. For a one-time build, run `npm run build`.

Heatflask development typically involves two terminal windows. The backend server [`dev-run`](/backend/dev-run) running in [`/backend`](/backend)) and serving at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, and the Parcel watcher (`npm run watch`) running in `/frontend`.  With the backend server running and frontend dependecies built and bundled, you should be able to get Heatflask running in a browser at [`http://127.0.0.1:5000`](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

As long as the watcher is running, whatever changes you make to files in [`/frontend/src`](/frontend/src) will be reflected at [`http://127.0.0.1:5000`](http://127.0.0.1:5000).  Browser developer tools are available in most browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with the shortcut `ctrl-shift-i`.

If there are any problems getting this working, please create an [issue](https://github.com/ebrensi/heatflask/issues). Otherwise, Congratulations!ðŸ¥³

I look forward to your contributions.  Let's make Geospatial Dataviz Great Again!
