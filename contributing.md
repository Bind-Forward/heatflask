For setting up the backend-server, see the `README.md` in [`/backend`](/backend), and for the front-end dpendency building, see that file in in [`/frontend`](/frontend).

## Code Style Guidelines
### Client-side (frontend)
For frontend development we use [standardjs](https://standardjs.com), which is based on ESLint.  Pull requests that have a lot of Linting errors will not be merged.

When you install frontend dependencies with `npm install`, it is installed for you as a dev-dependency.  You can then integrate it with whatever IDE you like.  I personally perfer [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com) and [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io) for text editing, and [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) as a Git UI.  I like it simple.

### Server-side (backend)
The backend, well, that's just a mess.ðŸ˜©  But it works for now.  More guidelines to come when I get around to that code.


### More specifics to come...
